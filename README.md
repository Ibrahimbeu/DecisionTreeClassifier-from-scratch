## It has both fit and predict parts
In Scikit-learn, optimization of decision tree classifier performed by only pre-pruning.
Maximum depth of the tree can be used as a control variable for pre-pruning
## Two hyperparameters added min_samples and max_depth
These two hyperparameters are most common ones
